# Graph-Neural-Networks
This repository hosts implementations of various Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE. These models are crucial in machine learning tasks involving graph-structured data, such as social network analysis, molecular chemistry, and recommendation systems.
